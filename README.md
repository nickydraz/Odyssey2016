# Odyssey2016

This repo holds the production version of the Odyssey Pickup Assistant. The system was designed and built by the students of CSC 495 Spring 2016 term at [North Central College](http://www.noctrl.edu). 

Odyssey was built for Sharing Connections, a Downers Grove-based charity. The program is built using Ruby on Rails. Its main goal is to make Sharing Connections' pickup scheduling process more efficient, while also wrapping the program in a visually pleasing package. 

This repo is a fork of the official repository, so that I can make small changes to it without affecting the group.
